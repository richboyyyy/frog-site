    <div class="content">
        <p>Frog is a no-rules Minecraft server that has been running for several months and has had hundreds of players join at least once. You can hack, grief, kill, steal, and dupe while possible.</p>
        <p>Frog was started 11/14/2024 at around 6:00 PM CST with the intent for a Minecraft server without any rules, no admin interference, and a map that never resets.</p>
